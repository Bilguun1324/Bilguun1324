### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bilguunâ€”a passionate full-stack developer and a computer science student at UNSW. 
I really enjoy building up user-facing websites using React JS and Next JS.
As for back-end development I'd like to use GraphQL, MongoDB and Firebase.
Currently, I'm immersed in the exciting realms of two innovative startups, Gradify and OnCourse.
